# Programmatic submissions for Ingest

This repository contains the instructions, both theoretical and practical (Via Jupyter Notebooks) to understand and
perform submissions programmatically into ingest.

The documentation is deployed in GH pages for easy visualization and navigation: https://ebi-ait.github.io/ingest-programmatic-submissions/

The instructions to test the GH pages locally can be found on the technical docs, 
[testing locally](technical_docs/testing_locally.md).
